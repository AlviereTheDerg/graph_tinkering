# graph_tinkering
I recently finished Graph Algorithms, and I'm curious what some look like in action.

## Current plans
1: construct a maze generator :white_check_mark:\
2: construct a visualizer with matplotlib to display steps of algorithm execution with methods supplied as generator functions :white_check_mark:\
3: construct a BFS search for the visualizer and test it on the mazes generated :white_check_mark:
   - and it's little DFS too
4: find another random graph generator to utilize for larger samples
5: Beam search
6: Djikstra and A*
