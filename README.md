# graph_tinkering
I recently finished Graph Algorithms, and I'm curious what some look like in action.

## Current plans
- [x] construct a maze generator
- [x] construct a visualizer with matplotlib to display steps of algorithm execution with methods supplied as generator functions
- [x] construct a BFS search for the visualizer and test it on the mazes generated
   - and it's little DFS too
- [ ] find and fix issue causing execution to hang after closing matplotlib window
- [ ] find another random graph generator to utilize for larger samples
- [ ] Beam search
- [ ] Djikstra and A*
