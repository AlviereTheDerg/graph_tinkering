# graph_tinkering
I recently finished Graph Algorithms, and I'm curious what some look like in action.

## Current plans
1: construct a maze generator
2: construct a visualizer with matplotlib to display steps of algorithm execution with methods supplied as generator functions
3: construct a BFS search for the visualizer and test it on the mazes generated
